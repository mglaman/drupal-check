# drupal-check [![Build](https://github.com/mglaman/drupal-check/actions/workflows/php.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mglaman/drupal-check/actions/workflows/php.yml) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/mglaman/drupal-check.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/mglaman/drupal-check) [![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/mglaman/drupal-check.svg)](https://github.com/mglaman/drupal-check/releases/latest)

Built on [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan), this static analysis tool will check for correctness (e.g. using a class that doesn't exist), deprecation errors, and more.

Why? While there are many static analysis tools out there, none of them run with the Drupal context in mind. This allows checking contrib modules for deprecation errors thrown by core.

Are you ready for Drupal 9? Check out our [Drupal 9 Readiness](https://github.com/mglaman/drupal-check/wiki/Drupal-9-Readiness) instructions for details on how this tool can help.

* `--format[=FORMAT]` - Formatter to use: raw, table, checkstyle, json, or junit [default: "table"]
* `-d, --deprecations` - Check for deprecations
* `-a, --analysis` - Check code analysis
* `-s, --style` - Check code style
* `--php8` - Set PHPStan phpVersion for 8.1 (Drupal 10 requirement)
* `--memory-limit[=MEMORY-LIMIT]` - Memory limit for analysis
* `-e, --exclude-dir[=EXCLUDE-DIR]` - Directories to exclude. Separate multiple directories with a comma, no spaces.

```
php vendor/bin/drupal-check web/modules/contrib/address

* Check the address contrib module for deprecations:

```
php vendor/bin/drupal-check -d web/modules/contrib/address
```

* Check the address contrib module for analysis:

```
php vendor/bin/drupal-check -a web/modules/contrib/address
```

## Rollback update to PHPStan level 2 for deprecation analysis

drupal-check:1.4.0 set PHPStan's analysis level to 2 for deprecations and 6 for analysis. This ensures basic analysis
errors are fixed to provide the best deprecated code detection experience. You can read more about PHPStan's rule
levels here: https://phpstan.org/user-guide/rule-levels

If you do not want to run PHPStan at level 2 and only report deprecation messages, use the following instructions

```shell
composer remove mglaman/drupal-check
composer require  --dev phpstan/phpstan \
  phpstan/extension-installer \
  mglaman/phpstan-drupal \
  phpstan/phpstan-deprecation-rules
```

Create a `phpstan.neon` file with the following:

```neon
parameters:
	customRulesetUsed: true
	ignoreErrors:
		- '#\Drupal calls should be avoided in classes, use dependency injection instead#'
		- '#Plugin definitions cannot be altered.#'
		- '#Missing cache backend declaration for performance.#'
		- '#Plugin manager has cache backend specified but does not declare cache tags.#'

	# FROM mglaman/drupal-check/phpstan/base_config.neon
	reportUnmatchedIgnoredErrors: false
	excludePaths:
		- */tests/Drupal/Tests/Listeners/Legacy/*
		- */tests/fixtures/*.php
		- */settings*.php
		- */bower_components/*
		- */node_modules/*
```

You can copy this from the Upgrade Status module directly https://git.drupalcode.org/project/upgrade_status/-/blob/8.x-3.x/deprecation_testing_template.neon
